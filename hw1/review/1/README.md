### Interesting Points

1. Implemented gradient color on the container so it looks nicer :laughing:
2. The slider is moveable and will change the degree of opacity when mouse hovers.
3. The play icon will change to pause icon when mouse hovers over it.
4. The icons I used are from https://material.io/icons/. 

5. Below is my reference music player .
